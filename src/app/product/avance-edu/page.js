            <p>Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP) are commonly used to implement Agile practices.
            These methodologies emphasize iterative development.
            <br /><br/>
            Agile transformation requires a significant shift in organizational culture.
            Agile emphasizes delivering value to the customer through continuous feedback and collaboration.
            Teams must align their work with customer needs and ensure that every deliverable adds meaningful value.<br />

          <h5 className='dat'>Risk mitigation strategies</h5>
          <p>
            Risk are essential for identifying, assessing, and minimizing the impact of potential risks in a project, business operation, or any process. <br/><br/>These strategies help ensure that risks are managed proactively, reducing their likelihood and severity.

            Risk avoidance involves changing the project or process to eliminate the risk entirely<br /><br/>
            Risk transfer involves shifting the responsibility of a risk to a third party, typically through contracts, insurance, or outsourcing. This strategy doesn't eliminate the risk but moves the financial or operational consequences to someone else..

          <h5 className='dat'>Risk Acceptance</h5>
          <p>
          In this strategy, an organization accepts the risk because the cost of mitigating it is higher than the potential impact, 
          or the probability of the risk occurring is low.
           Itâ€™s a conscious decision to live with the risk.<br/><br/>
           A small company might accept the risk of a minor cybersecurity threat, judging that the cost of security upgrades is too high compared to the probability of an attack.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           This strategy focuses on using technology to reduce risk exposure, often by automating certain processes or monitoring activities to detect and respond to risks early.
